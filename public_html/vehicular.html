<h2>Vehicular Recreation</h2></center>
<p>

Fairlee Forest’s groomed snowmobile trails are part of a truly “<a target=”new” href=http://www.vtvast.org>VAST</A>” (Vermont Association of Snow Travelers) network extending across the Northeast and into Canada.  Fairlee members of VAST keep its section of trail so well-groomed and compacted that, in a good winter, they make for excellent hiking tracks with none of the ruts and boulders evident in summer and no need for snowshoes. People have even been known to sled and ski on them, though this is obviously risky. In the early days when snowmobiles were noisy and polluting, and some drivers were disrespectful of private property, increasing restrictions were being proposed to limit snowmobile use. Since then, VAST has worked hard to make good citizens and neighbors of its members. The machines themselves are much quieter and cleaner now, and the operators in Fairlee Forest set a good example of what courteous, responsible vehicular recreation should be. 
<p>
The <a target=”new” href=http://www.vtvasa.org/>Vermont All-Terrain-Vehicle Sportsman’s Association (VASA) </A> has the same goals as VAST but a more difficult job. Vehicles operating on dirt trails invariably cause wear and tear, but especially so where trails are wet or muddy. While most drivers in Fairlee Forest are responsible, it only takes one vehicle during mud season, or one hot-rodder in any season, to undermine a trail people have been working to repair. The same is true of trucks, which according to one knowledgeable source, are the main cause of damage to forest roads.
<p><i>
NOTE: only residents of the town of Fairlee are permitted to use ATVs in Fairlee Forest.  </i>
<p>
There are no restrictions on the use of motorcycles or bicycles on the forest trails, but such use has been light so far. Since they do disturb the soil, they should not be used on the hiking trails. The same could be said for horses. We trust those who enjoy this kind of recreation to stay on the forest roads and take extra care in wet areas.
