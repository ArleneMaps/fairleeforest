 <b><i>What is a forest festival?</i> </b></b>
It is a celebration of our magnificent forests and
the many ways they enrich our lives. It is about trees and plants, birds and wildlife, the ways we use and enjoy our forests, and the ways we manage and protect them, including things we can do in our back yards.
<p>
<b><i>Why?</i></b>
Because 2016 is the first year of the second hundred years of Vermont Town Forests. Because it’s worth doing.
<p>
<b><i>What will be in it?</i></b>
Horses and hawks, big machines, booths with wood crafts and products, hands-on activities and demonstrations, foods and beverages, and much more! <!--There will be workshops and demonstrations on woodland skills and safety, panel discussions and talks on forest stewardship and other topics in the Town Hall. -->  There will be exhibits of forest art and writing by area children, displays of environmental education projects by area classrooms, a forest-creature costume parade for little kids.   There will be live mountain music as well.  AND IT WILL NOT RAIN!
<p> 
There will also be 3 hikes on Sunday July 3rd, the day following the festival.  One is an early (7:30am) birding hike, the second is a hike to the top of Bald Top Mountain (10:30), and the third is a questing hike geared towards families to Eagle's Bluff (1:00 pm).  Signups will be available at the festival.

<p><b><i>Who is it for? </i></b> </b>It’s for residents and visitors, kids and adults, forest professionals and back yard birders, hunters and hikers, loggers and forest artists, forest managers and conservationists. In short, it’s for everybody!

<p>
 <b><i>How can you help?</i></b>  We need volunteers!  We need people to help with many aspects, both ahead of time with planning and organizing, and on the day of the festival to help with the outdoor programs, set-up, clean-up, parking and much more.  Please email us at info @ fairleeforest.org.
